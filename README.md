# Efficient Structure-preserving Support Tensor Train Machine

This repository contains MATLAB files for the implementation of work proposed in the paper
 [Efficient Structure-preserving Support Tensor Train Machine](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05079.pdf).

**Intro** 

The key novelty of our research is a stable and well explained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for low-rank tensor
 input data that manifests much higher classification accuracy and banchmarked compared to other state-of-the-art methods.
 Our paper presents a general SVM framework using the Tensor-Train decomposition 
 along with the explanation, validation and importance of each stage of the proposed algorithm with a graphical illustration.


 
**Results**
Each folder presents results for each step of algorithm, presented in paper.
