These MATLAB files are for the paper *Efficient Structure-preserving Support Tensor Train Machine*. The paper is available at the [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2002.05079.pdf). 

**Intro** 

The key novelty of our research is a stable and well explained Support Vector Machine (SVM) model for low-rank tensor input data that manifests much higher classification accuracy compared to several state-of-the-art methods including some other Support Tensor Machines. Our paper presents a general SVM framework using the Tensor-Train decomposition along with the explanation, validation and benchmarking of each stage of the algorithm.
